# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **please do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Existing Project (Milestone 1)

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

### Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project ( 1 or 2)
1

### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

site's _cohesive_ audience

The audience of my website are persons who never played Vanguard before and are curious about it, I see them as an appropriate audience for my website, as my website goes over the types of cards, how to read them along with the gameboard and how a players turn would go about. These are all things someone who has played Vanguard before would know about but not new players


### Audience's Goals (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

- The rules of the game
- What exactly are the 5 nations they may use
- How read the different cards in the game


## Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- To have a carousel that would cycle through the different unit leaders instead of it being a long line of text that appears on screen
- Having a drop down menu on my navigation bar to make it allow users to jump to very specfic parts of that page



### Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch several iterations of your interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)

 idea sketches

![Sketch of the dropdown menu implenation](sketches/drop-down-menu-sketch.jpg)


### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)
> Create _polished_ sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

 final sketch(es)

![final sketch to show that the carousel on the nations page has a timer](sketches/final-sketch-timer-carousel.jpg)


### Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (3-5 sentences)

 design rationale
The drop down menu has one specific function for this webpage. They are there so that users visiting the page can jump to very specific sections on a page. The carousels are there so they could cycle through images with ease, also they help to make the website look cleaner and allowing each item to be the center of attention on it


## Interactivity Implementation Plan (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Planning Sketches (Milestone 1)
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.

![2nd sketch showing the interactivity on the nations page](sketches/interactive-sketch2.jpg)

### Interactivity Pseudocode Plan (Milestone 1)
> Write your interactivity pseudocode plan here.
> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Please do not put JavaScript code here.

```

### "Ambitious" Interactivity Explanation (Milestone 1)
> In your own words, concisely explain why you believe your interactivity meets the "ambitious" requirement.
> This should be a few sentences. (1-3 sentences)

 ambitious justification
I believe my interactivity meets the ambitious requirements for mainly 2 different reasons. Firstly it contains carousels that would make the page feel less clutered along with having one of them with a timer to change the image shown at a set interval. The second reason would be the addition of a dropdown menu on the navigation bar that allows users to jump to very specific parts of the webpage


## Grading (Final Submission)

### Interactivity Usability Justification (Final Submission)
> Explain how your design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a large paragraph (4-6 sentences)

 interactivity rationale

Going over those points I believe my design uses them effectiviely. Firstly with visibility, all of my interactiveity is visbible when they are are needed on screen, for example all of my carousels, the images on them are visible to all users and only disappear only when the image changes to the next one as to make it not seem to clutered. The drop down menus also uses this as they are only visible when they are needed by the user. Next affordances, all the buttons that have some sort of function change to a pointer cursor to tell the user that they can click it,and in the case of my nav bar they also have an arrow pointing downwards to signify that a drop-down menue will appear when clicked.This goes in hand with feeback as any button clicks makes and immediate change on screen that is very visible to users. Finally there is familiarity which my design uses as it matches exactly how users would interact with similar objects on different websites.


### Tell Us What to Grade (Final Submission)
> We aren't re-grading your Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed, we won't grade it.

 what should we grade
1. My nav bar on all of the pages
2. Carousel on the index.html page under the types of triggers header
3. The entire nations.html page / nations and ridelines page after the map


### Collaborators (Final Submission)

 list your collaborators

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

 self-reflection

I learned that JavaScript is similar to the structure of some coding languages so it was easier for me to follow along which was a surprise to me. It had some parts to it which was a little difficult to me. One thing I had to get use how specific the classes should be for the selectors as that was one of the most difficult parts of the project for me.In order for me to get it to work I had to restructure alot of my code for the project. But it was still a fun experience


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

 self-reflection

When I first started this class I never thought I would reach this point where I am at right now. I would look at things such as carousels I thought I was not gonna be able to create such a thing, heck I even thought it was a built in object, I never knew that I had to make it from the ground up. But here I am making something that I thought I would not be able to do into a reality, which makes me happy to know that I have slowly been improving as the class has gone on.
